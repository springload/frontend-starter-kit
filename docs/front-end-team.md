## Front-end team OKR (Objectives Key Results)

Each person’s objectives and key results are tracked in a Trello board based on a [reusable template](https://trello.com/b/URsGqKMe/person-s-okr-template).

The basic board structure is very simple. If you feel the need to change it, go for it. To start using it as-is, look at the instructions on the [OKR template card](https://trello.com/c/WsoJOi7z/28-okr):

- The **Member** on the card defines whose OKR this is.
- The **Title** is the `Objective`. Make it inspiring!
- **Labels** with colors define the general theme. We do not want to have too many labels around, so only go for one or two themes.
- **Labels** without colors allow further classification as required without cluttering the board.
- The **Checklists** are the `Key Results`. Use one Checklist per Key Result.
- **Checklist Items** are "Actions". They are either done (checked) or not.
- The **Due Date** defines when the OKR is due (end of quarter).

### Defining objectives and key results

The basics, totally stolen from [re:Work - Guide: Set goals with OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/):

- Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable
- Key results are measurable and should be easy to grade with a number (from 0 to 1.0)
- OKRs are public so that everyone in the organization can see what others are working on
- The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough and they need to think bigger
- Low grades should be viewed as data to help refine the next OKRs
- OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations
- OKRs are not a shared to-do list
- [Further objectives and key results tips on re:Work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/set-objectives-and-develop-key-results/)

### Examples of objectives and key results

## Front-end code reviews

The front-end team frequently collaborates on their different projects, formally and informally. This collaboration can happen through pair programming and code reviews, among other practices.

### Why we do code reviews

- Improve the overall quality of the work.
- Enforce and propagate our standards of quality, best practices, and coding styles.
- Spread the responsibility and knowledge for any given piece of work.
- Be beneficial for both reviewee and reviewer – in varying proportions depending on the purpose of the review.

> Want to know more? Go have a look at [Code Reviews: Just Do It](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-reviews-just-do-it/) from Jeff Atwood.

### Doing a code review

When presenting code for review, or reviewing a given piece of code, follow those guidelines:

- Keep the review concise. Ideally, the code under review should fit on one's screen.
- Think about the bigger picture.
- Concentrate on the intention rather than the syntax – if there are stylistic issues, suggest using a linter.
- Reviews do not need to focus on the negative - if a piece of code is good, it is worth stating as well.
