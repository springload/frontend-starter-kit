## Performance Review

> During the discovery phase of a project we can use this document as a template to review the client's current website and set goals for the performance of their new site. We can use this document to present our findings and suggestions to the client.

### Why performance?

> Use this section to explain the importance of performance for both the client, and the client's customers.

Web performance is the measure of how quickly your audience can access your site and services.

Fast sites create happy users. Studies show that when a site responds slowly, visitors spend less time there and are less likely visit again. Good performance not only improves user experience but can also improve a website’s search rankings – Google now prioritises both site speed and mobile-friendliness in their search listings.

### Current performance statistics

> Test across varying network speeds, setup [Speedcurve](https://speedcurve.com/) and run tests through [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/).

**Speeds across a variety of networks:**

| Connection Speed | Start Render | Document Complate |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Slow - 2G | 18+ seconds | 38+ seconds |
| Medium - 3G | 4 seconds | 10 seconds |
| Fast - Cable | 0.9 seconds | 4 seconds |

**Document complete** is an important performance metric, and we will be using this as part of our ongoing analysis in the new website build. It tells us when a page has finished loading, and its interactive elements start being usable.

> To visually show the website loading, add links to [WebPageTest's](http://www.webpagetest.org/) videos or include timeline images/graphs.

**Network requests**
*Network requests are the number of requests made by the browser to the server to get the pieces of content on the page.*

Currently **site name** makes **[65] network requests**, and **[1.31MB] of data is downloaded** to the homepage. The majority of the requests are made up of JavaScript (22 requests), CSS (8), images (18) and fonts (5).

```[Add pie graph or similar here to show visually.]```

```[Add a summary here of what is largely contributing to the weight and/or number of requests.]```

Major contributors here are the Add This social sharing plugin, which sends multiple JavaScript requests; and the jQuery carousel (image slideshow).

### Browser & OS findings

Statistics taken from web analytics.

| OS | % of users |
|---------|-----------|
| Windows | 58% |
| Android | 20% |
| iOS | 18% |
| Mac | 4% |

| Browser | % of users |
|---------|-----------|
| Chrome | 41% |
| Internet Explorer 11 | 16% |
| Safari | 16% |
| Firefox | 7% |
| Internet Explorer 9 | 3.6% |


### New performance targets
> Set out what we aim to achieve here:

We will be building this new website with mobile in mind – from our findings above just under half of [Client Name]’s users are on a mobile device. This is one of the reasons it is especially important to optimise for performance. Users on a mobile device may experience limited coverage or network dropouts; our aim here will be to shorten load times, reduce network requests and have appropriate fallbacks when JavaScript is not available.

**We will aim for a 20% speed increase** and will use the mobile 3G statistics to help us determine our targets for page size and number of requests. We intend to use mobile 3G as it is a common usage scenario in which performance is crucial to the experience.

**Current time: [Site Name] on mobile 3G**

| Start render | Document complete | Fully loaded |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 4.831s | 10.951s | 11.323s |
| **Target: 20% speed increase** |
| 3.86s | 8.76s | 9.05s |
| Page size: 376 KB | Page size: 858 KB | Page size: 882 KB |


Our performance targets on a 3G connection will be:
- **Document complete** in 8.7 seconds
- **Page size of 882 KB**, made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, Video (Youtube) and fonts
- No more than **45 page requests**.

### Improving performance: Planned actions

We will continue to assess performance throughout the design and build phase, and may make design tweaks to keep the new site within our targets. We’ll:

- Optimise images and use SVG icons where possible (for logos, sharing icons etc). SVG also ensure the icons are crisp across different monitors and displays.
- Use best practices, such as minifying and combine CSS and JavaScript files, which will reduce requests and page size.
- Look at using alternatives to some of the JavaScript plugins on the page – as noted above, the Add This social sharing buttons add a lot of weight; we could get a similar effect using plain links and analytics tracking at quarter the size.
- Further improve the perceived performance of interactions where necessary (through the use of interaction feedback, animation and loading icons). Perceived performance refers to how fast a user thinks the website is, not necessarily how fast the technical stats say. This can often make the site feel just that much faster.
- Provide appropriate fallbacks for interactions where JavaScript is not available.
- Gracefully degrade support on older browsers.
- Set up web tools such as webpagetest.org and SpeedCurve to measure and monitor both the current site and the new site.


### Glossary

- **Start render:** The start render time is the moment the page stops being blank and the user can actually see something in their browser, for example some text or a background color.
- **Document complete:** This is the point in time when all the content referenced in the HTML is fully loaded. This usually happens after the content and all of the images have loaded – but may not include content that is triggered by JavaScript execution.
- **Requests:** This is the number of requests made by the browser to the server to get the pieces of content (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc).
- **Bytes in / page size:** This is the amount of data that the browser has to download in order to load the page.
