# Browser & device support temmplate

Copy this into your project's README.md and update with your supported browsers.

Note that `N` refers to the current version number, and so `N - 3` means that the site would support the 3 previous versions of that browser.

**Supported browser / device versions:**

| Browser | Device/OS | Version |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Mobile Safari | iOS Phone | N - 3 |
| Mobile Safari | iOS Tablet | N - 3 |
| Chrome | Android | N - 3 |
| Chrome | Desktop | N - 3 |
| MS Edge | Desktop | N - 2 |
| Firefox | Desktop | N - 3 |
| Safari | OSX | N - 2  |

If IE11 support is required we suggest increasing the overall FED budget (perhaps by as much as 10% depending on the project) and having this as a separate line item on the proposal to indicate the increased development time.

> Those browser / device / version combinations are the ones the site *is tested* on. 

> Our development standards means sites **must** still be usable on older browsers, users must be able to navigate *most* pages, content must be readable, important interactions must still work **and will work on future browsers**.
