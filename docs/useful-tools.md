# Useful tools

## [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/)

> Collaboration app for UI designers and front-end developers

We use [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to do designer / developer handovers.

Why we like Zeplin:

- It forces designers to be very accurate and consistent in their designs (margins / measurements), over multiple screens.
- The CSS export of specific styles is copy/pasteable as a starting point, to refactor.
- It facilitates sharing naming conventions between disciplines.

How we use it:

- Designs are exported from Sketch to Zeplin.
- The "Scene" is useful to share designs with clients / third parties without giving them complete access.
- The "Styleguide" provides a good overview of type sizes, colors, components. It is automated so it picks up inconsistencies right away.
- Setting up Zeplin and structuring the Sketch file accordingly takes time, but then updating it is very simple/fast.
