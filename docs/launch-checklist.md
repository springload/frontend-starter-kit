# Project launch checklist

> Handy things to check when launching a project.

> **This checklist is where we want to be**, not necessarily where we always are. Ideally we would want as many of those line items to already be taken care of by our starter kit and other boilerplates. In practice, it is not that simple and we need such a checklist to make sure that we deliver top-notch experiences.

```
      __...--~~~~~-._   _.-~~~~~--...__
    //   Vorsprung   `V'    Pauca      \\ 
   //   durch Technik |     sed bona    \\ 
  //__...--~~~~~~-._  |  _.-~~~~~~--...__\\ 
 //__.....----~~~~._\ | /_.~~~~----.....__\\
====================\\|//====================
                    `---`  
```

## How to use this

1. It will take you **around 2 hours** to go through this list if you've done it before. Make sure you have the time. Ask for support.
2. Open the [raw markdown files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/springload/frontend-starter-kit/master/docs/launch-checklist.md), copy the content of the checklist sections and paste it into a new GitHub issue on the relevant project.
3. In the GitHub issue, move through the whole list and check items as you go.
  - All of the items should be checked.
  - If an item is irrelevant it should be checked and a reason should be mentioned.
  - If an item cannot be tackled because of other constraints, backlog the problem and potential fix where appropriate.
  - If you've spotted/fixed something, take note of it in the same issue so that we can see the impact of this process on our ratio of bugs per project.
  - If you added new checklist items, consider adding them back in the main checklists.
