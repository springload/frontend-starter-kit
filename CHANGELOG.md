# 20.8

- Merged our Webpack configs for SilverStripe and Django/Wagtail. Recover any files from [the history](https://github.com/springload/frontend-starter-kit/commit/d8e1cc4b31e6df6a8f6fc29eea4cd759adbcc449).

# 20.1

- Updating Wagtail starter to use TypeScript.
- Removing [React Patterns](https://github.com/springload/react-patterns) and [Quicktube](https://github.com/springload/quicktube)

# 19.5

- Removing Github labels (in favour of default labels and Jira), and removing Analytics error tracking in favour of Sentry

# 18.10

- For CSS in JS we like ~~Glamor~~ **_Styled-Components_** :nail_care:

# 18.5

- Trashed the `recycle-bin`. Recover any files from [the history](https://github.com/springload/frontend-starter-kit/tree/c35abe435eb4905565e79a8bbc5cc257b2e5a77c).

# 18.1

- `gh-pages` repo deleted and moved to the `recycle-bin`.
- Frontend checklists merged. The distinction between what was necessary to know at launch vs start was dubious.

# 18.0

Version 18... the big 20**18** refactor!

Old things that we're not sure about have been moved to the `./recycle-bin` (because although people could extract files from the Git history, we want non-techies to easily access some of these).

- `core/static_src/svg` :arrow_forward: :wastebasket:
- `core/static_src/js` :arrow_forward: ...the following table

| Before                   | After                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `polyfills.js`           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| _Promise polyfill_       | Nothing! Modern browsers have Promise already so the need for this is reduced. IE11 doesn't support Promises but use [`bluebird`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird).                                       |
| _Object.assign polyfill_ | The `object.assign` polyfill can be replaced by Babel features.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `format.js`              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| _Date formatting_        | Prefer [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) available in modern browsers and IE11, or [`date-fns`](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns) if necessary |
| _padNumber_              | Use lodash's pad functions.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| _humanNumber_            | Use [`Number.toLocalString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString) noting the Intl arguments and older Safari compat problems                  |
| `keycodes.js`            | Use [`keycode-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keycode-js)                                                                                                                                                     |
| `interface.js`           | Nothing! Browser detection code and constants for `NBSP` as unicode are things you can find online                                                                                                               |
| `analytics.js`           | Uh... I'm not sure what on earth this is doing :arrow_forward: :wastebasket: in the meantime                                                                                                                     |
| `/components/*`          | :arrow_forward: :wastebasket:                                                                                                                                                                                    |
